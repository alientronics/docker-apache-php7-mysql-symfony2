The host machine must have Docker installed in order to build and run the Container.
Instructions on how to install Docker can be found on the official [page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 - Install Docker Compose
 
Docker Compose helps on orchestrating the communication between the `application` container and `mysql` container.
Instructions on how to install Docker Compose can be found on the official [page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

 - Clone source code
 
 On the host machine clone the GitHub(`git` is required to be installed) repository by executing:
 
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/alientronics/fleetany-docker
 ```
 
 - Run Docker
 
 Go to the root directory of project and execute command:
 
 ``` 
    sudo docker-compose up
